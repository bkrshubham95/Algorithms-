    "Locality of reference .\n",
    "\n",

    "Worst case can be avoided \n",

    "\n",
    "(b) If we want to sort a linked list of elements then we should choose MergeSort as merge sort performs better than quicksort in case of linked list as linked list negates that advantages like locality of reference as in linked list subsequent nodes might not be in the adjacent memory\n",
    "In case of linked lists, merge sort does not require auxiliary space for its merge operations. So, even the memory advantage of QuickSort over MergeSort doesn't hold true in case of linked lists.\n",

    "For Accessing a element in linked we have to traverse to the index of that element node by node So accessing random element requires more memory and since quicksort depends on multiple memory access of this kind therefor uses a lot of memory."
